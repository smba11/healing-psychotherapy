  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>
    Hello and welcome! I’m Tesfaye Gebreyohannes, PMHNP, and I’m glad you’re here.
    I believe therapy is a collaborative journey — a place where your story matters,
    your experience is honored, and your growth is the focus.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you’re struggling with anxiety, mood concerns, stress, or simply feeling stuck,
    my goal is to create a safe, nonjudgmental space where you can explore your thoughts,
    feelings, and goals at your own pace.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therapy isn’t about having all the answers — it’s about uncovering your strengths,
    understanding your patterns, and learning new ways to respond to life’s challenges.
    I look forward to walking alongside you as you build a life that feels meaningful
    and authentic.
  </p>
